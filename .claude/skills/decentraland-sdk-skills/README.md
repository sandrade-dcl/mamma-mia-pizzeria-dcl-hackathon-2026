# Decentraland SDK Skills

AI coding skills for building [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org) scenes with SDK7. These skills provide context and guidelines for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Cline, Windsurf, and others) to help you create, extend, and deploy Decentraland scenes.

## Quick Start

Install everything with a single command — no flags needed:

```bash
npx skills add decentraland/sdk-skills
```

This installs the root skill which includes behavioral guidelines, the composite-first rule, an index of all topic skills, and references to all sub-skill documentation.

You can also install individual topic skills if you only need specific areas:

```bash
npx skills add decentraland/sdk-skills --skill create-scene
npx skills add decentraland/sdk-skills --skill add-3d-models
npx skills add decentraland/sdk-skills --skill multiplayer-sync
```

Or install all individual skills at once:

```bash
npx skills add decentraland/sdk-skills --all
```

| `audio-video` | Sound effects, music, audio streaming, and video players. |
| `authoritative-server` | Headless authoritative server for multiplayer. |
| `build-ui` | 2D screen-space UI with React-ECS (JSX) — HUDs, menus, dialogs. |

| `script-components` | Script component classes for the Creator Hub. |

## What Are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI coding assistants the context they need to write correct code for specific frameworks and platforms. They're installed using the [Vercel Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel/skills) and work with any AI tool that supports `.cursor/skills`, `.claude/skills`, or similar conventions.
