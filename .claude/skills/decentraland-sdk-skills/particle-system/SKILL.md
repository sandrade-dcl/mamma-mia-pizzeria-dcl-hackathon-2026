description: Emit particles (fire, smoke, sparks, snow, magic, fireworks) from an entity in a Decentraland SDK7 scene with the ParticleSystem component. Covers emitter shapes (Point, Sphere, Cone, Box), continuous rate vs Burst emission, lifetime/size/color/velocity ranges, gravity and additionalForce, blend modes (ALPHA/ADD/MULTIPLY), billboard and faceTravelDirection, sprite-sheet texture animation, simulation space (local vs world), playback state, and per-scene particle budget. Use when the user asks for particles, sparks, fire, smoke, dust, fog, fireworks, magic effects, snowfall, rain, embers, trails, or atmospheric effects. Do NOT use for procedural entity motion (see animations-tweens), GLTF model effects (see add-3d-models), or 2D UI effects (see build-ui).

# ParticleSystem (SDK7)

Emit particles from an entity. One `ParticleSystem` component per entity, attached alongside a `Transform`. No mesh required — particles render from the component itself.

## RULE: Transform.scale does NOT scale particles

Particle size is controlled exclusively by `initialSize` and `sizeOverTime` (FloatRange). The `ParticleSystem` also sets emitter shape's spatial dimensions when the shape has size fields (Sphere radius, Box size, Cone radius). These are not affected by the entity's `Transform.scale`. Setting `Transform.scale` larger does not produce bigger particles.

## RULE: Particles only render to players inside scene parcels

Players viewing the scene from outside its parcels see nothing. Particles are not part of the scene LOD silhouette. Position emitters within parcel bounds.

## RULE: Particles only work in the Unity explorer

The mobile Godot explorer and the Bevy explorer don't have this feature implemented. The renderer ignores the component.

## RULE: Engine caps total particles at ~1000

The engine enforces a per-scene particle budget and will scale down emission rates across all active particle systems if total live particles would exceed the limit. Cap each system with `maxParticles` and prefer fewer impactful systems over many small ones.

## RULE: prewarm requires loop = true

`prewarm: true` only takes effect when `loop: true`. On a one-shot system (`loop: false`) prewarm is silently ignored.

## RULE: faceTravelDirection overrides billboard

When `faceTravelDirection: true`, particles orient along their velocity vector and `billboard` is ignored. Use this for trails/streaks (asteroids, bullets, sparks). Set `billboard: false` explicitly to avoid confusion.

## Import

```typescript
import { engine, Transform, ParticleSystem } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import {
	PBParticleSystem_BlendMode,
	PBParticleSystem_PlaybackState,
	PBParticleSystem_SimulationSpace,
} from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { Color4, Vector3, Quaternion } from '@dcl/sdk/math'
```

Aliases `ParticleSystemBlendMode` and `ParticleSystemPlaybackState` are also exported from `@dcl/sdk/ecs` and are interchangeable with the `PB`-prefixed names. **There is no `ParticleSystemSimulationSpace` alias** — only `PBParticleSystem_SimulationSpace`. Prefer the `PB`-prefixed names everywhere for consistency.

`FloatRange = { start: number, end: number }` — random value sampled per particle.
`ColorRange = { start: Color4, end: Color4 }` — random color sampled per particle (each end of the range is sampled independently of the other particle randoms).

## Emitter shapes

Build with the `ParticleSystem.Shape.*` helpers — never assemble the `oneof` manually:

```typescript
shape: ParticleSystem.Shape.Point()
shape: ParticleSystem.Shape.Sphere({ radius: 1 }) // default radius=1
shape: ParticleSystem.Shape.Cone({ angle: 25, radius: 1 }) // angle = half-angle in degrees
shape: ParticleSystem.Shape.Box({ size: Vector3.create(1, 1, 1) })
```

- **Point** — emits from the entity origin.
- **Sphere** — random points inside a sphere of `radius`.
- **Cone** — emits from base disk, projecting outward within `angle` half-angle. Default cone direction is the entity's local forward; rotate the parent Transform to aim it.
- **Box** — random points inside an axis-aligned box of `size`.

To **rotate the emission direction** (e.g. point a cone downward for snow/rain), rotate the parent entity's `Transform.rotation`. Example: snow falling from a cone uses `rotation: Quaternion.fromEulerDegrees(180, 0, 0)` on the entity, or any orientation that flips the cone axis.

## Bursts

Discrete emission events at specific times. Set `rate: 0` to use bursts only, or combine with `rate > 0` for continuous + bursty.

```typescript
bursts: {
	values: [{ time: 0, count: 100, cycles: 1, interval: 0.01, probability: 1.0 }]
}
```

Burst fields: `time` (s from cycle start), `count` (particles per burst), `cycles` (default `1`, `0` = infinite), `interval` (s between cycles, default `0.01`), `probability` (0–1 chance per cycle, default `1`).

Multiple bursts in one cycle = staggered ignition pattern (fireworks).

## Common patterns

```typescript
// 1. Fire ember — Point + ADD blend, slight upward drift
const fire = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(fire, { position: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8) })
ParticleSystem.create(fire, {
	rate: 40,
	lifetime: 2,
	maxParticles: 200,
	initialSize: { start: 0.1, end: 0.3 },
	sizeOverTime: { start: 1.0, end: 0.0 }, // shrink to nothing
	initialColor: {
		start: Color4.create(1, 0.6, 0.1, 1),
		end: Color4.create(1, 0.2, 0, 1),
	},
	colorOverTime: {
		start: Color4.create(1, 0.5, 0.1, 1),
		end: Color4.create(0.2, 0, 0, 0),
	},
	initialVelocitySpeed: { start: 1.5, end: 2.5 },
	gravity: -0.3, // negative = rises
	blendMode: PBParticleSystem_BlendMode.PSB_ADD,
	shape: ParticleSystem.Shape.Point(),
})

// 2. One-shot burst — explosion/pickup VFX
ParticleSystem.create(entity, {
	loop: false,
	rate: 0,
	lifetime: 3,
	maxParticles: 150,
	initialSize: { start: 0.1, end: 0.25 },
	sizeOverTime: { start: 1.0, end: 0.0 },
	initialVelocitySpeed: { start: 2, end: 4 },
	shape: ParticleSystem.Shape.Sphere({ radius: 0.5 }),
	bursts: {
		values: [
			{ time: 0, count: 100, cycles: 1, interval: 0.01, probability: 1.0 },
		],
	},
})
```

## Playback control

```typescript
const ps = ParticleSystem.getMutable(entity)

// Pause emission and freeze existing particles
ps.playbackState = PBParticleSystem_PlaybackState.PS_PAUSED

// Resume
ps.playbackState = PBParticleSystem_PlaybackState.PS_PLAYING

// Stop and clear all live particles
ps.playbackState = PBParticleSystem_PlaybackState.PS_STOPPED

// Disable new emission (existing particles continue to live out their lifetime)
ps.active = false
```

Use `playbackState = PS_STOPPED` for a hard cut. Use `active = false` for a graceful trail-off.

## Sprite-sheet animation

Texture atlas with frames laid out in a grid (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). Total frames = `tilesX * tilesY`.

```typescript
texture: { src: 'assets/Images/flame-sheet.png' },
spriteSheet: { tilesX: 4, tilesY: 3, framesPerSecond: 12 }   // 12 frames, plays at 12fps
```

Test-scene examples use `4x3` (12 frames) and `1x20` (20-frame strip) sheets at 10–30 fps.

## Simulation space (local vs world)

- `PSS_LOCAL` (default) — particles move with the emitter. A moving emitter drags its particle cloud. Suits aura/halo effects on a moving entity.
- `PSS_WORLD` — particles stay at their spawn position in world space. A moving emitter leaves a trail behind it. Required for proper trails when combined with `Tween` movement on the emitter.

## Texture field

The `texture` field uses the same `Texture` type as `Material`. Common case (local file):

```typescript
texture: {
	src: 'assets/Images/spark.png'
}
```

The full Texture form supports filterMode/wrapMode but particle systems generally only need `src`. Avatar/Video textures on particles are unverified — stick with file textures.

## Gotchas

- **Texture path** — particle textures default to `assets/Images/`. Same path conventions as Material textures. Legacy scenes may have them under `assets/scene/Images/` or `assets/scene/textures/` (still works); Creator Hub assets land in `assets/asset-packs/`, `assets/custom/`, or `assets/scene/` — reference those paths as-is.
- **Quaternion rotation fields** — `rotationOverTime` is interpreted as per-axis angular velocity (quaternion → Euler XYZ). `Quaternion.fromEulerDegrees(0, 90, 0)` = spin 90°/s on Y. Identity = no spin.
- **`additionalForce` is world-space** even when `simulationSpace = PSS_LOCAL`. Wind/drift directions stay constant regardless of emitter rotation.
- **`limitVelocity.dampen = 1`** = hard clamp (particles never exceed `speed`). Lower values let velocity exceed cap briefly then decay.
- **Color.alpha = 0 at end of `colorOverTime`** is the standard way to fade particles out — don't rely on `sizeOverTime` ending at 0 alone.
- **Bursts ignore `active = false`** at the moment of evaluation — `active` is checked once per frame for continuous rate; setting it after a burst time will not retroactively cancel that burst.
- **No mesh attached to the emitter entity** — adding `MeshRenderer` is unrelated; particles render via the ParticleSystem component itself.

## Performance

- Cap each system with `maxParticles`. Total scene budget across all systems is ~1000 particles.
- Keep `lifetime * rate` low; that product is the steady-state live count.
- Disable systems out of view via `playbackState = PS_STOPPED` or `active = false`.
- Prefer `PSB_ALPHA` for opaque/translucent effects. `PSB_ADD` is best for glow/fire (it stacks visually) but multi-layer additive overdraw is the most expensive case.
- Sprite sheets are cheap; multiple textures per system is not supported (one texture per system).
